100 day coding challenge
Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.

ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Arrays â€“ Reversing an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

ðŸ“Œ Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

ðŸ“Œ Day 3: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern

ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Dyanmic Array
Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0.

ðŸ“Œ Day 5: Left Rotation

Problem statement :A left rotation  operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. The elements 1 that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result.

ðŸ“Œ Day 6: Digital Frequency:

Problem Statement:Given a string,s , consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

ðŸ“Œ Day 7:String Similarity

Problem Statement:For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.

ðŸ“Œ Day 8:Nth Term

Problem Statement:There is a series,s , where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a , b, and c respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion

ðŸ“Œ Day 9:Power Calculation

Problem Statement:Help Shashank in calculating the value of  S, which is given as follows. Since the value of S  can be very large, he only wants the last 2 digits of S .

ðŸ“Œ Day 10:Permuting Two Arrays

Problem Statement:Complete the twoArrays function in the editor below. It should return a string, either YES or NO.

ðŸ“Œ Day 11: Array Reversal

Problem Statement:Given an array, of size n, reverse it.

ðŸ“Œ Day 12:Student Mark

Problem Statement:The array name,marks , works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words,marks contains the address where marks is stored in the memory.
